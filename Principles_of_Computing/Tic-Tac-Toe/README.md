## Tic-Tac-Toe (Monte Carlo)
### Overview

[Tic-Tac-Toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is a simple children's game played on a 3×3 grid. 
Players alternate turns placing an "X" or an "O" on an empty grid square. The first player to get three-in-a-row wins. 
If you know the appropriate strategy and your opponent does not, you cannot lose the game. Further, if both players understand 
the appropriate strategy the game will always end in a tie. An interesting variant of the game is "reverse" Tic-Tac-Toe in which 
you lose if you get three-in-a-row. The game is also more interesting if you play on larger square grids.

For this assignment, your task is to implement a machine player for Tic-Tac-Toe. Specifically, your machine player will use 
a Monte Carlo simulation to decide its next move. We will provide both a console-based interface to the game where your machine 
player will play against itself and a graphical user interface where you can play against your machine player. Although the game
is played on a 3×3 grid, your version should be able to handle any square grid. We will continue to use the same 
[grid conventions](https://class.coursera.org/principlescomputing1-003/wiki/grids) that we have used previously.

For this mini-project, we will provide you with a complete implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe Board class. However, 
for your part of the mini-project, we will provide only a very minimal amount of 
[starting code](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#poc_ttt_template.py). We will also dispense with the phased description of the implementation process so that your coding task for this mini-project is a more 
realistic example of the software development process.
