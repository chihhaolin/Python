## 2048
### Overview
2048 is a simple grid-based numbers game. The rules of the game are described here.

For this assignment, your task is to complete the implementation of a version of the 2048 game. 
Since we will provide a graphical user interface for the game, your task is to implement the game logic in terms of 
a `TwentyFortyEight` class in Python. Although the original game is played on a 4Ã—4 grid, your version should be able 
to have an arbitrary height and width. Since we will use grids in several assignments, you should familiarize yourself 
with the [grid conventions](https://class.coursera.org/principlescomputing1-003/wiki/grids) we will use in this course.

We have provided the following [template](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#poc_2048_template.py) that contains an outline of 
the `TwentyFortyEight` class. The signature (name and parameters) of the functions, classes, and methods in this file 
must remain unchanged, but you may add any additional functions, methods, or other code that you need to.
